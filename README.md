**Cross-site scripting attack**

Cross Site Scripting attack is client-side code injection attack. It is a type of injection attack.
Attacker injects malicious codes into a legitimate website. It is also called as XSS. 
Execution of XSS attack requires user interaction.

The exploitation of XSS against a user can lead to various consequences such as account compromise, account deletion, privilege escalation, malware infection and many more.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
